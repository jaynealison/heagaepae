                            <p> Hey everyone. I recently began freelance video editing and web design. While I‚Äôm decent at editing video, I‚Äôm a complete beginner to recording it. One of my good friends asked me to film and put together a short promotional video for his service. Due to the very short time he needed it by, I ended up using the my iPhone X to record both the video and audio, and while it turned out good enough, I would like to learn how to record much better video (and audio) in the future. I‚Äôve looking for a camera to record motorsport events with, along side my gopro hero 5. my budget is around 0 USD. the only main features i prefer are 1080 60fps, as its what i record on my gopro, and an input for an external. Hi, I'm looking into getting a camera/camcorder to make interviews with. Most of the websites/forum I read were based on making movies, filming outside, or making youtube blogs so weren't really what I needed. I'm looking to get a camera to film interviews of others so I need to have crisp videos. As for sound, I'm thinking of getting a mic and attaching it to my phone to record sound separately since I heard getting good sound on DSLR is tough. The location is inside all the time so I don't. 
Example: If one photo is one megabyte, why isn't a one second video at 24 fps, which has 24 photos in one second, 24 megabytes? I get that it's to do with compression, but how could you compress that without losing too much quality and pixels? Pls explain. Timestamp (https://imgur.com/ZsoVqeH) These are capture cards removed from old video servers. These were barely used and have been in storage for a few years. I have tested them all to make sure they can still capture video. They will not come with any accessories. These went for 00 new but the value now is nearly impossible to gauge. The value seems to be entirely dependent on what the buyer is willing to pay based on need. I have seen these sell for 0-0 on ebay and as little I have been having for a long time, but mainly on my 3DS Xboxes and PS3. I have been waiting and saving up for years to finally be able to get to build myself a PC, but now I am finally able to afford it and have been given the okay to do it Im not home to build it. I'm out of state, and won't be back for a while, and when I finally do get back home I will have to start my computer up and get to work on school. Basically, I am completely lost at this point. I have been looking at ibuypower. After a few years of using a laptop, I'm looking to get a new desktop computer. I don't care about hardware as long as it's sufficient for what's it needed for at the moment, so I don't have up to date knowledge on the different components. If there's a good enough suggestion for a pre-build, I'll go with that. I'm a gamer, but I don't care much for graphics. I'm looking for something that can run most games on medium settings. I'd think that allows major savings on the graphics card?. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8PmsDM4lUYampab_channel=Bal00n. Hi, this is my first time building a computer. I just wanted to check for any useful comments. I want to reduce the price of this setup if possible. Please tell me if I did anything wrong with my reddit post :) PCPartPicker part list ( / Price breakdown by merchant ( / Benchmarks ( Type Item Price :---- :---- :---- Motherboard ASRock Z77 Pro3 ATX LGA1155 Motherboard. Hey buildapc, I'm just starting to shoot video with my new Canon 5d mkii, and my laptop isn't up to speed for the editing. I've recently moved to Berlin, and don't really know where to look for desktop computing needs. Also, I've just reinstalled Windows 7 Pro 64bit on my laptop which has gone quite smoothly. I'm thinking I might be best served building my own desktop with which to edit video - what should I be looking for? I'd also like to consider trialing a hackintosh build - so I could. So my dad is one of these people who stores everything on his desktop. His current PC is maybe 8 years old and keeps bluescreening and on the odd occasion that it doesn't, it takes 15min to boot up. I need a PC which will be super fast to boot up and have maybe 1tb of memory for all his junk. What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using. ‚Ä¢ YouTube videos occasionally, emails, word, excel What is your maximum budge. 
## Help on these PC Builds üì∑ Hello, I know so little about computers. I only know how to use them. I went into a local PC shop and explained to the employee what I wanted and he provided me 3 PC Builds below. Before you look at those, I will explain what I am using this desktop for. USES! My main use for this will be playing WoW Classic when (if) it releases. I can see myself playing future games on PC, so future performance would be nice but not a priority if I am able to upgrade parts. So my PC build rn has these parts installed CAS: CyberPowerPC AZZA 260S Mid-Tower Gaming Case w/ Full-size Tempered Glass Panel Window + 7 color RGB LED (Included) (White Color) CD: 24X Double Layer Dual Format DVD+-R/+-RW + CD-R/RW Drive (Included) (BLACK COLOR) CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 1700 3.0GHz 3.7GHz Turbo Eight-Core 16MB L3 Cache 65W Processor (Included) FAN: AMD Certified CPU Fan amp Heatsink (Included) HDD: 1TB SATA-III 6.0Gb/s 32MB Cache 7200RPM HDD (Included) (Single Drive) MEMORY.

Welcome to Role Call! The only word vomit which references the 4‚òÖ units you didn't get on that 10+1, all those neat 3‚òÖ units that you DID get, and the 5‚òÖ that you just blew Lapis-Balls for but didn't get because you failed to work hard enough! Last time I finished up on Healers, however whereas the previous five units I've covered were Healers first and other shit second, I'd be amiss if I didn't mention Summoning, a role all in itself. Furthermore, of the Summoner units in the game, three. I'm trying to run Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius for the PC, released in 2001, on my computer.

Hi All, amp#x200B; I am currently running my Plex server out of a standard ATX CPU Case and I realize I probably won't make it more than 3 more years without running out of room for hard drives. (Hard drives are 8TB and less). amp#x200B; Which got me thinking of moving to a legit NAS server hardware, and I found this beauty: https://www.theserverstore.com/supermicro-846ba-r920b-24x-lff-4u-server.html (https://www.theserverstore.com/supermicro-846ba-r920b-24x-lff-4u-server.html). Our demand that Canada denuclearise immediately has not been answered (m: ok, I cba to wait for Markath to do a bunch of bullshit diplos to Meles so I'm just going to say that I sent the request, Canada didn't reply within an IG hour and therefore President Baker has his authorisation), and as such Case Orange will be activated.
