I never heard of this movie but it’s pretty awesome as an office fan. Cameos from Kevin, Angela, Kelly. The honeymoon they plan is in Sandals (Jamaica). Job Krasinski stars and is very Jim like in his mannerisms. Great office fan movie and I never heard of it so I wanted to throw it out there. Mary makes a decision about her future; Kate must prove herself at Fashion Week LA; the cast travels to Jeremiah's wedding and meets his fiancé; a wedding day mishap threatens the ceremony. Just watched the movie on Netflix because I saw Jim was in it. But I was surprised to see Kelly, Kevin and Angela.

That cooler-than-thou attitude would grate if Krasinski.
